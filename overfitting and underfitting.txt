#overfitting and underfitting and how to avoid and overcome it

Overfitting (High Variance) Occurs when a model learns noise instead of patterns, performing well on training data but poorly on unseen data.
More Data: Collect or augment more data to reduce model sensitivity to noise.
Regularization:Use L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge) regularization to penalize complex models.
Dropout (for Neural Networks):** Randomly drop neurons during training to prevent reliance on specific paths.
Early Stopping: Stop training when validation loss starts increasing.
Cross-Validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure model generalizability.
Feature Selection: Remove irrelevant or redundant features to simplify the model.
Underfitting (High Bias) Occurs when a model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
Increase Model Complexity: Use more layers (for deep learning) or a more sophisticated model.
Feature Engineering: Create new meaningful features from existing data.
Reduce Regularization: If regularization is too strong, relax it to allow the model to learn better.
Train Longer: In deep learning, let the model train longer with proper monitoring.
Use More Features: Ensure that the model has enough informative features to learn from.
By balancing complexity and generalization through these methods, you can improve model performance and avoid both overfitting and underfitting.

#uniform distribution

A Uniform Distribution is a type of probability distribution where all outcomes are equally likely. It is characterized by a constant probability over a given range.
There are two types of distribution:
->Continuous uniform distribution
->Discrete uniform distribution

**A continuous uniform distribution is defined over a range [a,b], where every value within that interval is equally likely to occur. The probability density function (PDF) is constant.
Continuous uniform is used for real numbers (e.g., heights, time).
**A discrete uniform distribution assigns equal probability to a finite number of distinct values.
Discrete uniform is used for countable values (e.g., dice, lottery).
